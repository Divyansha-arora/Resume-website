    I am an architect who has worked over projects in urban, commercial, landscaping and interior architectural design, I have built an impeccable sense of what computes a holistic design. Looking forward, I believe that working in data solutions and UX design would enable me to actualise my professional aspirations of pursuing a career in data-driven business consultancy, with an objective of customer focused design.

    <p> As a visionary designer with a problem solving attitude, I believe I can shape the fundamental structures in which firms function by adding a more formalized and accessible system. As a result, I believe that my experiences and values align with my ambition to transfer and integrate the two professions. A team facilitator and hard worker with an attitude of learning and gaining skills, looking for an opportunity to push the current limit of my abilities. <!-- here's an example link to a totally external website on another server; how would you link to a different page within this same project?

<h4>Reasons I'm amazing</h4>
<p>Being creatively curious, I pursued my Bachelor’s degree in Architecture from the University School of
Architecture and Planning, Indraprastha University. This curriculum combined my theoretical knowledge
with practical abilities in critical thinking, space design, and consumer requirements. Moreover, five years
of undergraduate education expanded my horizons to integrate design and profit maximization with the
best interest of all the parties associated with the project of building a living space. Academically, studio
classes such as Design Studio helped me gain creative insights and problem-solving skills.</p>

    <p>
<p class="3rd para">For as long as I have dabbled in the world of optimal usability, the one thing that I’ve learned that must always remain supreme is the meaningfulness and relevance of visceral emotions and how a space is reflective of human behavior in design. In this regard, as an architect I wear many hats– designer, visionary, psychologist and analyst, truly understanding the dimensions of a project and possessing a creative mindset to think about how things can be explained, interpreted and utilized. These theoretical underpinnings were a direct result of the courses I undertook during my graduate degree. Moreover, my preference was highly weighted towards generating high-quality products based on feedback."</p>
